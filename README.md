# R6s-ReplayBackup
A simple ahk script for backing up all R6s Replays.\
After initial use it saves the provided directories in a seperate appdata folder, so you can simply run the script to copy all 10 recent replays.\
At the moment it's not possible to view replays outside of Rainbow Six, so if you want to watch one of the seved replays, you have to manually copy it back into the R6s replay-folder.\
If you want to reinitialize you can do so by deleting the %appdata%\ahkReplayBackup\ folder.
